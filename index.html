    What is the overhead ratio?<br>
    The overhead ratio is a measurment of the operating costs of doing business compared to the income of the company. Low overhead ratio indicates that the company is limiting business expenses that aren't related to production.<br>
    How to calculate overhead ratio?<br>
    To calculate overhead ratio you should use the following formula:<br>
    overhead ratio = operating expenses / (taxable interest income + operating income)<br>
    example: company x has an operating expenses of $27,000 operating income of $132,000 and $53,000 in taxable interest income, calculate the overhead ratio.<br>
    using the overhead ratio formula the answer will be:<br>
    overhead ratio = operating expenses / (taxable interest income + operating income)<br>
    overhead ratio = $27,0000 / ($53,000 + $132,000)<br>
    overhead ratio = 14,59%<br>
    Why use overhead ratio?<br>
    overhead ratio is usually used to provide an indication of indirect costs of a company compared to it's direct costs of manufacturing or gross sales.<br>
